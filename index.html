    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Md Sohan Hossain. I'm currently a second-year student at Mirza Golam Hafeji College, with roll number 501. I was born on October 10, 2006. Alongside my studies, I’m passionate about graphic design — it’s something I truly enjoy and practice regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I live in Mostofa Building, located in Sripur, Ashulia, Dhaka. I love being online — whether it's to learn new things, spend quality time, or do creative work. I also enjoy playing football, working out at the gym, and making people laugh with jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in friendships and am grateful to have close friends like Enamul, Ashraful, Shawon, Tanvir, Habib, and Fahad by my side.
